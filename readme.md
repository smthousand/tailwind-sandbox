# Tailwind Sandbox

This is part of my Tailwind From Scratch course. The sandbox contains around 20 different folders/files that focus on specific aspects/classes of Tailwind.

If you are taking the course, use the **"tailwind-sandbox-starter"** folder and work through the course with me. The **"tailwind-sandbox-done"** folder is obviously the finished code.

We are just using the Play CDN for this part of the course.

The main projects for the course will be in a different repo.
